AIgument offers a novel and engaging way to experience the capabilities of Large Language Models. Instead of static benchmarks, users can stage dynamic debates between different AIs like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Flash.

The platform allows for customization of debater personalities (e.g., Detective Noir, Drag Queen) and debate intensity ("spiciness"), providing both entertainment and insight into AI interaction styles. Debates can be saved and browsed, creating a library of AI-generated arguments.
