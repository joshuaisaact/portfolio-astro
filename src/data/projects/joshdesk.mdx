JoshDesk streamlines hybrid work coordination through a simple Slack interface. It solves the common problem of tracking who's in the office on which days, eliminating the need for messy spreadsheets or constant messaging. Built with TypeScript and Bun, this project focuses on delivering a frictionless user experience directly within Slack.

The app provides a 4-week view of team attendance, making it easy for teams to coordinate in-office days. With two-click status updates and automatic weekly schedule resets, JoshDesk reduces the overhead of managing hybrid work arrangements while improving team coordination.
