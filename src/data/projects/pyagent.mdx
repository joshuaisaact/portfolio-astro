architecture:
  backend: "Built with Python using Google Gemini SDK for AI inference. Implements function calling with tools for file operations (get_files_info, get_file_content, write_file) and script execution (run_python_file). Uses UV for package management and environment configuration via .env files."

PyAgent is a learning project that explores building AI-powered code assistants with Python. It leverages Google's Gemini API to create an agent capable of interacting with filesystems and executing Python code to complete complex tasks autonomously.

The project implements an agentic loop that can iteratively use its available tools - file reading, writing, and Python script execution - to accomplish multi-step objectives. Safety is a key consideration, with all operations restricted to a designated working directory and execution timeouts in place.
