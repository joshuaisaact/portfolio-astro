At JumpStart Hackathon, our team tackled a crucial challenge: making workplace diversity data more transparent and actionable. In just 24 hours, we built Foundations, a platform that transforms complex gender pay gap statistics into clear insights. Leading the frontend development, I worked with a team of four to turn this idea into reality, ultimately winning Best in Category against 20+ competing teams.

The platform analyzes data from over 11,000 UK companies, making it easy for stakeholders to understand and act on diversity metrics that are often buried in complex reports.
