I took on the technical challenge of building a voice-first social platform that required real-time capabilities and complex data relationships. I led the development of key infrastructure components, focusing on creating a scalable backend while ensuring a smooth user experience.

The project showcases my ability to architect complex systems, from implementing real-time WebSocket notifications to designing efficient database schemas for social relationships. Working within a team environment, I delivered enterprise-grade features that formed the backbone of the platform.
