Music Round started as a pub quiz game brought online. Players join lobbies with shareable codes and compete to identify songs from 30-second Spotify previews.

The real-time sync was the interesting technical challenge - multiple players need to see the same timer, same scores, and same round transitions simultaneously. Convex handles this with reactive queries that push updates to all connected clients.
