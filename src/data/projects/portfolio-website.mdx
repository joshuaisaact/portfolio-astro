You're looking at it! I wanted my portfolio to be more than just a showcase - it needed to demonstrate my commitment to clean code, performance, and thoughtful user experience. Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript, this site combines modern web practices with careful attention to accessibility and performance.

While it might be a simpler project than some others in my portfolio, it represents my approach to development: clean, efficient, and focused on the user experience.
