You're looking at it! After building my initial portfolio with Next.js, I rebuilt it with Astro to take advantage of its content-first architecture and superior static site generation. This migration was driven by Astro's perfect fit for a portfolio site - zero JavaScript by default, excellent performance, and a built-in content collections system ideal for blog posts.

The rebuild demonstrates my willingness to choose the right tool for the job. While Next.js is excellent for dynamic applications, Astro's approach to static content delivery and its minimal JavaScript footprint made it the better choice for a portfolio and blog.
